        <h1>Headings of the document</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <h1>Top level Heading</h1>
            <h2>2nd level Heading</h2>

        <h1>Paragraphs within the doc</h1>
        <p> 
            Helps U to create paragraphs for better readability. They form a seperate line when they start and when closed, it will make the next content move to another line. U can have as many no of paragraph tags U want in ur document. <br>
            But if U want a line to be broken, U could use &lt;br&gt;Tag. The line break tag is a self enclosing tag. U dont need to have a closing tag for it.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>U can have a Horizontal Rule(A Line) drawn within ur document using a Tag called &lt;hr&gt;. The hr tag helps in creating a horizontal line within the document. hr is also a self enclosing tag.</p>
        <p>

            Your content can be placed at the center using a Center tag. However this tag is now obselete, instead use CSS to achieve the center feature in ur html docs
            <center>
                <p>Use center tag to provide a content in the center alignment of the document</p>
            </center>
        </p>    
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Span tag</h2>
        <p>We use span tag if we want to present a static content within the same line. This will be <span style="color:red"> helpful for placing error information</span> or any sp part of the same line. Span works similar to p Tag but will not create a seperate paragraph. Used mainly for presenting content which must be placed in the same line. We call this as inline Container</p>
